This package is a foreach parallel adaptor for the Rmpi package.  The
Rmpi package was written by Hao Yu of the University of Western Ontario.
The foreach package was developed by REvolution Computing, and is
available on CRAN, but is also available as part of their "REvolution R
Enterprise" product, along with additional parallel adaptors that
support Windows, for example.

I wrote this package after leaving REvolution Computing because I liked
the foreach package, wanted to learn more about the Rmpi package, and
thought it might be of value of the R community by combining the speed
of Rmpi with the ease of use of foreach.

I would like to thank Dirk Eddelbuettel and Bryan Lewis for their help
on the doMPI package.  Both found problems in the package, and gave me
valuable feedback.  I was also greatly helped by Dirk's excellent "HPC
with R" tutorial.  It has information on using Rmpi that I didn't find
anywhere else.  Bryan researched various MPI topics for me, and gave me
access to an excellent little cluster for testing purposes.

I'd also like to thank REvolution Computing for encouraging me while I
was working on the foreach system during my days at that company.  I
hope they are successful at helping R users to get better performance
through their products.
